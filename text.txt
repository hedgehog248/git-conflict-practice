FIRE AND ICE

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in iced coffee.
Fire and Ice.
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

by Robert.
